Description: Estimation of gas transport properties (viscosity, diffusion, thermal conductivity) using Chapman-Enskok theory and of the second virial coefficient using the Lennard-Jones potential. Up to the third order correction is taken into account for viscosity and thermal conductivity. It is also possible to calculate the binary diffusion coefficients of polar and non-polar gases in non-polar bath gases. 16 collision integrals are calculated with four digit accuracy over the reduced temperature range [0.3, 400] using an interpolation function.
